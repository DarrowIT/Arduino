# Digital Hourglass
**“In this project, you’ll build a digital hourglass that turns on an LED every ten minutes. Know how long you’re working on your projects by using the Arduino’s built-in timer”**. In my example, I edited the value in millis() stored in the “long” datatype to a 10 second interval.
